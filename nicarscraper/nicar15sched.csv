In this panel, let's refine a site we've prototyped to collect and categorize these data smells. We're not building a site here, but we should leave this panel with a clear idea of what the features of a data smells compendium would be. A wiki seems like an obvious choice, but how does an entry look? How do we organize and collect these smells? What can we do to automate the tedious process of vetting a data set? We'll explore these questions. The session will begin with a basic exploration of the concept of data smells. From there we will discuss several questions about how to build a site for cataloguing data smells: * How do we document data smells? * Where do we host this site? * What are all the points in the reporting process where errors occur? * Checklists? Can we automate smell checks? * Can we bundle smells for common types of data into guides? * Can we make the data smells idea approachable for readers? | URL: http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/1494/1775/",International 4-5,False
